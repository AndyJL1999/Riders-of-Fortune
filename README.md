# Riders-of-Fortune

This is a Unity version of my text based adventure game "DnD". It works very much the same; you roll a dice and have the chance to come across 3 sparate scenarios.
You can either find a weapon, fight a monster, or rest. At the end you will face a dragon.
Depending on your XP and weapon you will have a chance to defeat the dragon and win!
